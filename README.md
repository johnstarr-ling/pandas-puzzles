Make data manipulation bearable. Solve pandas puzzles.

## Guide 
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) is one of the most popular Python packages for data manipulation. Knowing how to use `pandas` well can save you lots of time and labor. So that more people can reap the benefits of `pandas`, I've created some puzzles that can help you become more familiar with handling data of all different kinds.[^1]

Note that this repository assumes _no experience_ with `pandas`, though I _do_ expect that you have at least some Python experience. `pandas` beginners (cubs?) should start with the `easy` puzzles; those who have more experience with the package (yearlings?) can skim through these puzzles to ensure they've got good fundamentals. `medium` puzzles introduce more complex and less-common `pandas` methods and functions. Both `easy` and `medium` puzzles grow step-wise in difficulty and have more hand-holding regarding coding logic. `hard` puzzles attempt to mimic "real-world applications": each problem gives you a goal, raw data, and a gold dataframe, and you must figure out how to process the raw data into the gold dataframe. 

All puzzles are in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). Each problem is numbered and contains three kinds of cells: __goal__ cells tell you what you are supposed to do, __solution__ cells show you the intended output (though the actual solution itself is hidden), and __code__ cells are where you write your answer. __Code__ cells are marked with the comment `### YOUR CODE HERE`. If you find solutions that are more efficient than mine, please let me know and I will include this in the possible solutions set for each problem.

Some tips for solving these problems:
- Documentation is your friend. Use [it](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
- Dig around your data before you mess with it. 
- All of the `easy` and `medium` puzzles can be solved in less than two lines of code; most can be solved in one. If you are taking multiple lines of code to solve these problems, you should probably rethink your approach.

Best of luck!
